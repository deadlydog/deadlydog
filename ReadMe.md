# Hi, I'm Dan Schroeder, known on the web as deadlydog ðŸ‘‹

I have a passion for programming.
While these days I typically stick to Microsoft technologies,

[I blog](https://blog.danskingdom.com/) about programming and productivity tools, and have made [a few YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcESXeG56v-AZb63CGz1r7Q).

Most of the software I create is open source, although there are a few projects that I have hidden away in private repositories.
While most of my work is on GitHub, I also have a few in Azure DevOps.
